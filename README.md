A node.js interpreter for the Scheme programming language.

Inspired by Peter Norvig's articles describing a scheme interpreter implemented with Python.

[(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](https://norvig.com/lispy.html)
[(An ((Even Better) List) Interpreter (in Python))](https://norvig.com/lispy2.html)

I don't plan on targeting any specific Scheme standard at this point, but the overall intent
is to provide an interpreter that can be used while reading through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).
